    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        · The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be supported by the CNI implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context ReadOnlyRootFilesystem

    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        · Container has the same readiness and liveness probe
            Using the same probe for liveness and readiness is very likely dangerous. Generally it's better to avoid the livenessProbe than re-using the readinessProbe.

    [WARNING] StatefulSet has host PodAntiAffinity
        · StatefulSet does not have a host podAntiAffinity set
            It's recommended to set a podAntiAffinity that stops multiple pods from a statefulset from being scheduled on the same node. This increases availability in case the node becomes unavailable.
    [CRITICAL] StatefulSet has ServiceName
        · StatefulSet does not have a valid serviceName
            StatefulSets currently require a Headless Service to be responsible for the network identity of the Pods. You are responsible for creating this Service. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#limitations
